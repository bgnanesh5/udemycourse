. What is Migration? Why Migration to Cloud?
============================================
Cloud Migration: The process of tranferring data, applications, workloads from On-Permises to cloud
---------------   [AWS, Azure, GCP or any cloud providers]


Why : 
---
- Operational Costs: Operational costs are the costs of running your infrasture
- Workforce productivity: It is how efficiently you are able to get your services to market.
- Cost Avoidance: Cost avoidance is setting up an environment that does not create unnecessary costs
- Operational Resilience: Operational resilience is reducing your organization's risk profile and the cost of risk mitigation
- Business Agility: Ability to react quickly to changing market conditions. you can expand into new markets, take products to market quickly


Migration Strategies: The 6 R's:
=================================
1. Re-host:  lift and shift
2. Re-platform: lift, tinker, and shift
3. Re-purchase: Drop-and-Shop
4. Re-factor/Re-architect: Redesign, Cloud Native 
5. Re-tain: Do nothing, for now-revisit
6. Re-tire: Decommission or Get rid of.


VM Import and Export:
=====================
. What is VM Import Export
. Common Uses for VM Import Export
. How VM Import Export Works
. VM Import Export Steps


What Is VM Import/Export:
=========================
. VM Import/Export enables you to Import Virtual Machine(VM) images from your existing
  virtualization environment(On-Prem,DC) to Amazon EC2,and also to Export them back to your- On-Prem
  
. You can import Windows and Linux VMs that use VMware ESX or Workstation, Microsoft Hyper-v, and
  Citrix Xen virtualization formats.

. VM Import will convert your VM into an Amazon EC2 AMI, which you can use to run Amazon EC2 instances.

. AWS SMS (Server Migration Service): For large VM infrastructures, automates the import process
  there by reducing the workload of migrating large VM infrastructures.


Commom Uses for VM Import/Export:
---------------------------------
. Migrate your existing Applications and Workloads to Amazon EC2
. Import your VM Image Catalog to Amazon EC2
. Create a Disaster Recovery Repository for your VM images

Pricing:
--------
. VM Import/Export is available at no addditional charge,but you are 
  Charged for standard usage of Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.


How VM Import/Export Works:
===========================

VM -> Stopped VM --- Export from Virtualization environment ---> RAW,VHD,VMDK,OVA ---Import to AMZ S3---> VM catalog --create AMI--> AMI(Region)

AMI ---Create-instance-export-task---> Export from AMZ EC2 -> OVA,VHD,VNDK -> start VM -> VM


VM Import Export Steps:
-----------------------
. Prerequisite:
   . Download, install and configure AWS CLI.
   . vmimport - VM Import Service Role.

1. Export VM from its current environmment as an OVA file (or VMDK, VHD, or RAW)
   (if you are testing this make sure the VM has at least one user configured with password)
2. Create a S3 bucket and upload the VM image to S3 using upload/drag, or drop, or using AWS CLI.
3. Import your VM using the ec2 import-image command
4. Use the ec2 describe-import-image-tasks commad to monitor the import progress.
5. Once Import is completed Launch EC2 Instance from the AMI created, or copy the AMI to other region.


VM Migration using AWS VM Import Export:
========================================
1. Install AWS CLI in windows/linux
2. create IAM user - add user
	- select - Programmatic access  
	- select - Attach existing policies directly - select AdministratorAcess
	- we will get ACCESS key and SECRET Key
        - Access Key - AKIAXRX4AXQMPUG7U5PX
	- Secret key - 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

3. aws configure in AWSCLI

C:\Users\Administrator>aws --version
aws-cli/1.18.39 Python/3.7.7 Windows/10 botocore/1.15.39

C:\Users\Administrator>aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAXRX4AXQMPUG7U5PX
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 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
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text

4. Stop the VM 
5. Create S3 bucket and upload the stoppped VM/drag and drop
6. vmimport - VM Import Service Role
  link
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html
7. create role
8. role-policy.json
9. put-role-policy
10. container.json
11. check AMI's in Amz


awscli
exported our VM ova
uploaded VM OVA ==> S3
VMimport role, attached policies

import process import-image

AMI - Copy AMI in Action
